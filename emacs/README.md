# fsharp-mode

Provides support for the F# language in Emacs. Includes the following features:

- Support for F# Interactive
- Displays type signatures and tooltips
- Provides syntax highlighting and indentation.

The following features are under development:

- Intelligent indentation
- Intellisense support.

Requires Emacs 24+.

## Installation

### Package

`fsharp-mode` is available on [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) and can
be installed using the built-in package manager.

If you're not already using MELPA, add the following to your init.el:

```lisp
;;; Initialize MELPA
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
(unless package-archive-contents (package-refresh-contents))
(package-initialize)

;;; Install fsharp-mode
(unless (package-installed-p 'fsharp-mode)
  (package-install 'fsharp-mode))

(require 'fsharp-mode)
```

### Manual installation

1. Clone this repo and run `make install`:
    ```
    git clone git://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding.git
    cd fsharpbinding/emacs
    make install
    ```

2. Add the following to your init.el:
    ```lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/fsharp-mode/")
    (autoload 'fsharp-mode "fsharp-mode"     "Major mode for editing F# code." t)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fs[iylx]?$" . fsharp-mode))
    ```

Note that if you do not use `make install`, which attempts to download
the dependencies from MELPA for you, then you must ensure that you have
installed them yourself. A list can be found in `fsharp-mode-pkg.el`.

If you run into any problems with installation, please check that you
have Emacs 24 on your PATH using `emacs --version`.
Note that OSX comes with Emacs 22 by default and installing a .app of
Emacs 24 will not add it to your PATH. One option is:

`alias emacs='/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs'`

## Usage

fsharp-mode should launch automatically whenever you open an F#
buffer. If the current file is part of an F# project, and the
intellisense process is not running, it will be launched, and
the current project loaded.

Currently intellisense features can be offered for just one project at
a time. To load a new F# project, use <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>.

While a project is loaded, the following features will be available:

1. Type information for symbol at point will be displayed in the minibuffer
2. Errors and warnings will be automatically highlighted, with mouseover
   text.
3. To display a tooltip, move the cursor to a symbol and press
   <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> (default).
4. To jump to the definition of a symbol at point, use <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>.
5. Completion will be invoked automatically on dot, as in Visual Studio.
   It may be invoked manually using `completion-at-point`, often bound to
   <kbd>M-TAB</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-i</kbd>.
6. To stop the intellisense process for any reason, use <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>.

In the event of any trouble, please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding/) with the label `Emacs`.

## Configuration

### Compiler and REPL paths

The F# compiler and interpreter should be set to good defaults for your
OS as long as the relevant executables can be found on your PATH. If you
have a non-standard setup you may need to configure these paths manually.

On Windows:

```lisp
(setq inferior-fsharp-program "\"c:\\Path\To\Fsi.exe\"")
(setq fsharp-compiler "\"c:\\Path\To\Fsc.exe\"")
```

On Unix-like systems, you must use the *--readline-* flag to ensure F#
Interactive will work correctly with Emacs. Typically `fsi` and `fsc` are
invoked through the shell scripts `fsharpi` and `fsharpc`.

```lisp
(setq inferior-fsharp-program "path/to/fsharpi --readline-")
(setq fsharp-compiler "path/to/fsharpc")
```

### Behavior

There are a few variables you can adjust to change how fsharp-mode behaves:

- `fsharp-ac-use-popup`: Show tooltips using a popup at the cursor
  position. If set to nil, display the tooltip in a split window.

- `fsharp-doc-idle-delay`: Set the time (in seconds) to wait before
  showing type information in the minibuffer.
  
- `fsharp-ac-intellisense-enabled`: This mode overrides some aspects of
  auto-complete configuration and runs the background process automatically.
  Set to nil to prevent this.

### Key Bindings

If you are new to Emacs, you might want to use the menu (call
menu-bar-mode if you don't see it). However, it's usually faster to learn
a few useful bindings:

- <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd>:       Evaluate region
- <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd>:       Load current buffer into toplevel
- <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd>:       Evaluate current toplevel phrase
- <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>:         Evaluate current toplevel phrase
- <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>:         Mark current toplevel phrase
- <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>:       Show interactive buffer
- <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>:       Compile with fsc
- <kbd>C-c x</kbd>:         Run the executable
- <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>:       Open alternate file (.fsi or .fs)
- <kbd>C-c l</kbd>:         Shift region to left
- <kbd>C-c r</kbd>:         Shift region to right
- <kbd>C-c <up></kbd>:      Move cursor to the beginning of the block
- <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>:       Load a project for autocompletion and tooltips
- <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>:       Jump to definition of symbol at point
- <kbd>C-c C-t</kbd>:       Request a tooltip for symbol at point
- <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>:       Quit current background compiler process
- <kbd>M-n</kbd>:           Go to next error
- <kbd>M-p</kbd>:           Go to previous error

To interrupt the interactive mode, use <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>. This is useful if your
code does an infinite loop or a very long computation.

If you want to shift the region by 2 spaces, use: <kbd>M-2 C-c r</kbd>

In the interactive buffer, use <kbd>M-RET</kbd> to send the code without
explicitly adding the `;;` thing.

For key bindings that will be more familiar to users of Visual Studio, adding
the following to your `init.el` may be a good start:

```lisp
(add-hook 'fsharp-mode-hook
 (lambda ()
   (define-key fsharp-mode-map (kbd "M-RET") 'fsharp-eval-region)
   (define-key fsharp-mode-map (kbd "C-SPC") 'completion-at-point)))
```
