This directory contains mainly integration tests for the project.

To run the tests: `./runtests.sh`. This will run `git status` as its
last action. The tests are considered to have passed if there are no
changes to the various `output.txt` files. If a feature has been
changed, then there may be acceptable changes -- think carefully and
then commit them.

For absolute paths, there is an ad-hoc `sed` command to strip off
everything before `test`.

Really this lot should probably be done with NUnit or something, but
this was quick to set up.
